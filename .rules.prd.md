# PRD Management Rules

## 1. Progress Tracking

```
✅ Add checkboxes to all features
[ ] Not started
[~] In progress
[x] Completed

Example:
### Authentication
[ ] Login page
[~] Register form
[x] OAuth integration
```

## 2. Feature Completion Process

```
1. When implementing a feature:
   - Check UI Components Completed section first
   - Reuse existing components when possible
   - Only create new components if necessary

2. After completing a feature:
   - Mark it as completed in the relevant section
   - Add any new reusable components to UI Components Completed
   - Update dependencies if component was modified
```

## 3. Document Maintenance

```
🚫 Never Delete:
- Existing features
- Component documentation
- Flow descriptions
- Technical requirements

✍️ Only Modify:
- Checkbox status
- UI Components Completed section
- Implementation details when necessary
```

## 4. Component Management

```
When adding new components:

1. First: Check UI Components Completed
2. If exists: Reuse and adapt if needed
3. If new:
   - Add to UI Components Completed
   - Document:
     - Purpose
     - Props/Configuration
     - Usage examples
```

## 5. Example Format

```
### Feature Section
[ ] Feature Name
    🔄 Dependencies:
    - Component A
    - Component B

    📝 Notes:
    - Implementation details
    - Special considerations
```
